##Challenge

Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. Implement the following methods:

```enqueue(animal)```: adds animal to the shelter. Animal can be either dog or cat object.
```dequeue(pref)```: returns either a dog or a cat. If pref, a string, is 'cat' return the longest-waiting cat. If pref is 'dog' return the longest-waiting dog.
